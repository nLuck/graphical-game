Concept: This is an original game idea with an expansive approach. Players find themselves in a 
desolate landscape where the remnants of humanity struggle to survive. The primary objective is 
to establish and expand safe havens by strategically connecting survivors with unique skills and 
resources. Each survivor represents a crucial piece of the puzzle, and players must carefully 
consider the synergies created by connecting them. For instance, pairing a skilled engineer with 
a charismatic leader might result in the development of advanced structures and increased morale 
within the haven.  As players progress, challenges and dilemmas emerge, requiring thoughtful 
decision-making. The game introduces a dynamic narrative where the connections made influence the 
story and the development of the havens. Unforeseen events, such as external threats or scarcity 
of resources, add a layer of complexity, forcing players to adapt their strategies.
